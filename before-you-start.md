# Before You Start

Before you start, there are a couple tools you should install, get familiar with, and use throughout this "CTF" and others after this. 

1) First is getting familiar with and using linux. Linux comes with lots of tools and it is super easy to download additional ones, that will greatly help you with these challenges. Kali linux or Parrot OS are some of the best versions of the Debian distro to use. Downloading a virtual machine is the best way to use these.

2) Next, get familiar with using gdb. gdb is a debugger and disassembler that comes with linux. It allows you to step through code line by line, view and edit memory, and lots more. There are many other plugins you can use with gdb such as gef and pwndbg that I would recommend installing.

3) pwntools is a python library that can be downloaded and installed and comes with lots of great tools that you can use on the command line but is extremely helpful in writing automated python scripts. 

4) Ghidra is a great tool that takes a binary (a.out after running gcc program.c) and is able to decompile the assembly and machine code back into very accurate c code. This makes it much easier to figure out what the program is doing and how to exploit it. 

5) During the challenges, try not to view the given .c files. You can absolutely look at the code from ghidra but typically, you wont be given the actual source code, so try to get used to doing these without looking at those files.

6) Lastly, youtube, github, and personal blogs are your best friend in doing all this. It is expected that you will get stuck at some point, especially when first learning this, so keep pushing and dont give up!
