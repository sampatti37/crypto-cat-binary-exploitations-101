# Level 03

Nice work, the learning curve is starting to get higher as we move along. This next challenge is moving away from overwritng variables and is now overwriting the stack, more specifically, return addresses. Simply put, when a function, say ```main``` calls another funtion like ```do_input()``` from our last example, the return address of ```main``` is pushed onto the stack. This way, when ```do_input()``` is finished executing, it will see the address on the stack and return execution to that address which would be the next line in ```main``` after the function call.
